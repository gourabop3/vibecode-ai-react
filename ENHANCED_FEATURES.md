### 2. 🎯 Simplified & Effective Prompts
**Before:** 300+ line restrictive prompt with excessive limitations
**After:** Concise, empowering prompt that encourages rich features

**Key Changes:**
- Removed package restrictions
- Encouraged modern React patterns
- Added examples of rich applications
- Focus on production-ready apps
- Clear guidance for using all available packages

### 3. ⚡ Real-time Generation Feedback
**Before:** Silent background processing with no user feedback
**After:** Immediate response with live progress tracking

**New Features:**
- Instant API response (< 1 second)
- Real-time progress updates every 2 seconds
- Beautiful progress UI with animations
- Feature highlights during generation
- Estimated completion times
- Visual progress indicators

### 4. 🎨 Enhanced User Experience
**Created new components:**
- `GenerationProgress` - Beautiful progress tracking UI
- `useRealtimeGeneration` - React hook for live updates
- Real-time API endpoints for immediate feedback

### 5. 🧠 Improved AI Configuration
**Enhanced Gemini model setup:**
- Better temperature settings (0.7) for creativity
- Optimized token limits (8192)
- Enhanced model descriptions
- Production-focused training approach

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/generate-code` - Immediate response + background job trigger
- `GET /api/generate-code?projectId=X` - Status polling for real-time updates

### Hooks & Components
- `useRealtimeGeneration()` - Real-time generation state management
- `<GenerationProgress />` - Beautiful progress visualization

### Enhanced Sandpack Configuration
```typescript
customSetup: {
  dependencies: {
    // 25+ modern packages available
    "lucide-react": "^0.469.0",
    "uuid": "^9.0.1", 
    "date-fns": "^4.1.0",
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.26.1",
    // ... and many more
  }
}
```

## 🚀 What Apps Can Now Be Built

### Before (Limited):
- Basic Todo apps with unicode icons
- Simple forms with manual state
- No routing or navigation
- No charts or data visualization
- Limited to core React only

### After (Production-Ready):
